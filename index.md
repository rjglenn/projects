Project Summary

My goal this summer is to create a webpage of mapping resources for those who may find them useful on the North Slope. For example, hunters and local scientists alike rely on high resolution images of sea ice to monitor ice conditions during periods of high subsistence or research activities. Previously, this location-specific data was hunted down daily on the National Snow and Ice Data Center website, downloaded, and sent out to those who might find it useful. My goal is to streamline this process to make the data more easily accessible, as well as identify products that might be useful but no one is using.

Weather Resources

Barrow Webcam : Webcam updating with photos of the coast of Barrow from "Barrow Side" birds' eye view. Good for viewing weather and ocean conditions, tracking sea ice movement (time-lapse) 

Snow/Ice Resources

Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)
Instrument on earth-orbiting satellites Aqua and Terra. Views and captures landscape of entire Earth's surface every 1-2 days.
Uses
A. Land Cover : classifies images into 17 landcover/vegetation types
B. Snow Cover : distinguishes between snow, lake ice, clouds, ocean, snow covered ice on inland water
 Â   Also identifies percent snow coverage
C. True Color : shows earth's surface and clouds in true color
D. Thermal : shows thermal activity

Useful for: identifying various ice and snow conditions both on and offshore, monitoring vegetation and/or hunting grounds inland, capturing land surface characteristics 

Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS)
Scanning radiometer with 5 high resolution bands (I bands) and 16 moderate resolution bands (m bands) including a day/night band for night-time imagery. Data is distributed as individual granules (~3040 km x ~570 km). The instrument measures cloud and atmospheric properties, polar winds, ocean color and characteristics, land and sea temperatures, sea ice characteristics, wildfire characteristics, and surface albedo (reflectance). VIIRS data is used to improve our understanding of Earth's global climate.

Useful for: night-time particulate matter & air quality studies (PM 2.5), light pollution studies, atmospheric studies

Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) or Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (IfSAR)
Object detection system that uses radio waves to take 2- and 3-D images of the earth's landscape.
